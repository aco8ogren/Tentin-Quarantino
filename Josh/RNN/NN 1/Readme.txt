This is just a simple NN. 
Inputs: 
    Number of days since January 1st
    Longitutde
    Lattitude

Output:
    Predicted number of deaths on this day

Notes:
    Not very effective lmao
    Not tested, but it perhaps tends to average the data over counties, 
    so in many location the predictions are too low, while in others too high
